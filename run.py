Bond Market Integration Analysis

This script performs bond market integration analysis using TabNet, including data generation, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and prediction.

Components:
- BondMarketDataGenerator: Generates a synthetic bond market dataset for analysis.
- BondMarketDataPreprocessor: Preprocesses the dataset by handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- BondMarketFeatureSelector: Performs feature selection based on correlation analysis and feature importance ranking.
- BondMarketTabNet: Trains and utilizes the TabNet model for bond market integration analysis.

Usage:
1. Instantiate the BondMarketDataGenerator class to generate a synthetic bond market dataset.
2. Preprocess the dataset using the BondMarketDataPreprocessor class.
3. Perform feature selection with the BondMarketFeatureSelector class.
4. Train the TabNet model using the BondMarketTabNet class.
5. Make predictions on new data using the trained model.

Note: Replace the placeholder values with appropriate values specific to your dataset.
Also feel free to move the files out of their respective directories if you want to use them.
